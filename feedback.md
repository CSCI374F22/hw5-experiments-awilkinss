# HW5 Feedback

Note: numbers are based on the report rubric (https://cs.oberlin.edu/~aeck/Fall2022/CSCI374/Assignments/Group/CSCI374_FinalReport_Rubric.pdf)

- Abstract: 4

Nice abstract!


- Introduction: 3

Good introduction.

The first paragraph should be more about the big picture: e.g., why are we interested in machine learning?  Then the second is the specific problem you want to solve -- comparing different popular methods for supervised machine learning.


- Background and Related Work: NA

Not in HW5


- Problem: 3

Nice table and listing of the data sets.  It would help to add a couple sentences describing how these four data sets together help us evaluate the machine learing approaches (e.g., because of their range of data types and applications).


- Solution: 3.5

Good description of the three methods.


- Experimental Setup: 3.5

All of the details needed to reproduce the study were there!

The definition of recall was incorrect: it is over the number of times the label appears in the data set.


- Results: 3

Good analysis.  All of the parts of the POEM were there!

It was missing the last section and table comparing how often each method statistically significantly outperformed the others.


- Conclusions and Future Work: 3.5

Nice summary of the experiments.

We generally want more than one idea for future work.


- Tables and Figures: 3

Good use of tables and figures.

Tables and figures should always be numbered (you did this for the figures), have captions, and be referred to by number in the text.


- Organization and Flow: 3.5


- Spelling and Grammar: 4


- Citations and References: NA
